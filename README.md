### Description

An interactive fretboard made mostly based on the version of another github user "musicandcode".
I followed his wise teachings, expanded on his concept, and refactored it to suit my style. 

I was looking for a tool like this, and I saw some paid versions, which I got annoyed by and thought "I'm pretty sure I can make this myself"
So here it is. It's free baby.

### How to use it

Simply download this repository, and open the "index.html" file using any browser. I might add some kind of bundler in the future but not sure.

### Tech stack

Literally as bare-bones as it gets. The fretboard is made using CSS, with a texture image over it to give it that woody look.
Almost everything is done in plain Javascript, and it uses no back-end or anything like that.

### Future ideas ???

Might look into integrating Tonal.js for later functionalities which is a pretty cool music library. Writing it here so I don't forget about it. But right now I just kept it pretty simple, 
calculating scales and triads by simply using the intervals.
